# Employee_Attrition_Predicting_Who_Stays_Who_Leaves

# Overview

This Human Resources Analytics project aims to analyze employee data to identify patterns and predict employee attrition. It uses Python, Pandas for data processing, Seaborn and Matplotlib for visualization, and Scikit-learn for machine learning.

# Dataset

The dataset, Human_Resources.csv, contains various attributes of employees, such as daily rates, job roles, managerial years, and whether they have left the company (attrition).

# Features

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming the data for analysis, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing different aspects of the data to understand underlying patterns using histograms, KDE plots, and boxplots.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features and modifying existing ones to better capture the nuances in the data.
Correlation Analysis: Using heatmaps to understand the relationships between different features.
Machine Learning: Implementing Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier to predict employee attrition.
Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of machine learning models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.
